## Hi there, I'm Art! ðŸ‘‹

I'm the CEO of [Secure Web Solutions LLC](https://www.securewebsolutions.io).

Since graduating from Loyola University Chicago in 2005, I have spent my professional career specializing in web technology. I've worked with everything from PHP to .NET, C++ to Python, Windows to Linux... and just about everything in between.

**JavaScript is my core competency.** You'll usually find me hacking apps together with NodeJS, React and AWS, though I dabble in pretty much everything.

More recently I've developed an expertise in application security and penetration testing. Iâ€™m a recognized cybersecurity professional, holding ISC2 CISSP,  CompTIA CSAP, CySA+, and Security+ certifications.
